# 🍽️ Food Recipe Recommendation System
This project was developed as part of my internship at **App Innovation Technologies** from **June 2, 2025 to June 20, 2025**, focusing on the application of Machine Learning in building intelligent and user-friendly systems.

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Food Recipe Recommendation System** is a content-based ML application designed to suggest personalized food recipes to users based on their selected ingredients, dietary preferences, cuisine types, and course (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.).
The system analyzes user inputs and matches them against a dataset of recipes using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**. The goal is to generate intelligent recommendations that feel tailor-made — reducing the decision fatigue of “What to cook?”

## ⚙️ Key Features
- 🧠 **Ingredient-based Matching**  
  Uses text vectorization to find similar recipes based on ingredient overlap and frequency.
- 🍛 **Cuisine, Diet, and Course Filtering**  
  Lets users refine recommendations to fit specific food types or lifestyle preferences (e.g., Indian, vegetarian, breakfast).
- ⚡ **Real-time Recommendation Engine**  
  Built using **Streamlit** for a simple and fast interactive UI.
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing & ML**  
  Efficient data cleaning, transformation, and model building using **Pandas** and **Scikit-learn**.
